# Read and Write Basics

The C in CRUD stands for Create. Every app needs to create new items of some sort, such as a new user, a new product, or a new blog post. While the finer details of what fields each item has will vary, the principles are the same.

These will be your first tasks

- **Set up nested routing**: Integrate a new page with the app's existing layout for consistent navigation.
- **Build a form**: Use the Form component from Remix and some styled UI components from the Epic Stack to build a form for new issues.
- **Validate inputs**: Use Zod to verify user inputs are valid. We want to keep out bad data.
- **Define database structure**: Create a Prisma Schema for the Issue model, outlining the structure of the data.
- **Write to the database**: Use Prisma to insert new issues into the database
- **Read from the database**: Use Prisma to fetch issues from the database
- **Clear the form**: Reset the form after submission
- **Optimistically show new items**: Skip the network round-trip and start showing new items immediately

By the time you've finished these, you'll have built a robust form for creating new issues in the database, and you'll have a decent understanding of the tools we're using and how they work together.

Let's get started!
