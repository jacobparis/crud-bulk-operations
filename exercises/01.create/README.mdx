# Create an item

The C in CRUD stands for Create. In every application, there is a need to create new items â€“ be it a new user, a new product, or a new blog post. In this section, we will create a route and put a form on it to create a new issue in our issue tracker.

We'll also need to create a Prisma Schema for the Issue model and start using prisma to interact with the database.
