# Create a form

👨‍💼 Your next ticket is **"Users should be able to create an issue with a title."**
This one might take a couple exercises to complete, so for right now,
just focus on creating the form.

🧝‍♂️ Hi, I'm Kellie, your co-worker! After you completed the last ticket, I went into the new route you made and created an action. It doesn't do much yet, but it'll catch your form submissions and return a notification if the data was valid.

Forms are the classic way to send data to the server. There are two types of forms in HTML:

- `method="GET"` forms are the default. These forms take the data from the inputs and append it to the URL, which can be used for search forms, pagination, table filtering, and more.
- `method="POST"` forms send the data to the server in the body of the request, which is often used for creating, updating, and deleting data.

📜 Remix has an enhanced [`<Form>`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/form) component which works almost exactly like the classic html element `<form>`, but without causing a full page refresh.

The Epic Stack has some styled form components in <InlineFile file="app/components/forms.tsx" /> like `<Field />` which combines a label, input, and error message.

```jsx
<Field
	labelProps={{
		children: 'Username',
	}}
	inputProps={{
		type: 'text',
		name: 'username',
	}}
/>
```

There's also a `<Button>` component with some variants and styles built-in.

🐨 All the instructions for this exercise will be in the files themselves. You can go through them in any order.

	This exercise is just about creating the form. Don't worry about implementing
	the action for the form yet. We'll get to that soon.
