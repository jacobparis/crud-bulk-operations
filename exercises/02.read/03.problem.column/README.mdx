# Add a new column

👨‍💼 Your next ticket is "The issues table should have a new column showing the priority of the issue." Good luck!

Here you'll follow the supply chain of data from the database to the UI. You'll update the prisma query to select the `priority` field, then follow the data to the IssuesTable where you'll update the typings and the JSX to display the new column.

As you add the new column to the table, you'll have to tweak the table's grid layout to make room for it. Right now the whole table is a CSS Grid spanning 3 columns, and each row is a subgrid that spans those same 3 columns. Without the subgrid, some rows would have different column widths than each other and it wouldn't look like a table.

🐨 Kody will walk you through making the changes to the table styles. You'll need to add a 4th column to the tailwind grid class and then update the row to span 4 columns.
