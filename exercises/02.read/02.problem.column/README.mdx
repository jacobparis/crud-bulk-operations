# Add a column for the date

👨‍💼 Your next ticket is "The issues table should have a new column showing the month, date, and hour each issue was created." Good luck!

Dates can be tricky to work with, especially in a server-side rendered application. If the server renders a date in its timezone, and the client renders the date in its timezone, the date will flash between the two timezones as the client-side JavaScript takes over.

The easiest way to handle this is to format the date server-side in the loader instead of in any React components. This way the loader just sends a formatted string as the date and you can display it directly.

As you add the new column to the table, you'll have to tweak the table's grid layout to make room for it. Right now the whole table is a CSS Grid spanning 4 columns, and each row is a subgrid that spans those same 4 columns. Without the subgrid, some rows would have different column widths than each other and it wouldn't look like a table.
