The easiest way to fetch data in Remix is to use a loader. This will run server-side and send the data along with the HTML on the initial page load.

🦉 As best practice, always use Prisma's "select" feature to only grab the specific fields you need. This will help you avoid over-fetching data, which improves performance, and reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data.
